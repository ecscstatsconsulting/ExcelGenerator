<b>A Chrome Extension for creating Excel Spreadsheets from HTML Tables</b>
</p>

Uses the [js-excel-generator](https://github.com/ecscstatsconsulting/js-excel-generator) library to create the spreadsheets from HTML Tables.  User Interface allows selection of tables and settings for export.

The app is published on the Chrome App Store here: [Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/excel-generator/ppeejofkpebeikjaalhlmlmhldkhbgih)

It works well for basic tables.  Soon it will be upgraded to handle more complex instances.

Feel free to look at the code now and try it out.  Lot's of updates and a formal release will be coming very soon.
