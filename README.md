<b>A Chrome Extension for creating Excel Spreadsheets from HTML Tables</b>
</p>

Uses the [js-excel-generator](https://github.com/ecscstatsconsulting/js-excel-generator) library to create the spreadsheets from HTML Tables.  User Interface allows selection of tables and settings for export.

Protoype code for a Chrome Extension which generates Excel Spreadsheets from HTML Tables.  Code only functions during very basic conditions.  A table interpreter will be added to make it more robust.  A release will follow as well as a published version in the Chrome App Store.

Feel free to look at the code now and try it out.  Lot's of updates and a formal release will be coming very soon.
